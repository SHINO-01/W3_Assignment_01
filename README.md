The CSS has been optimized to improve usability across devices, adapting for various screen sizes.

Setup Instructions

Responsive Design
The CSS has been optimized to support smaller screens using media queries:

1024px or less: Reduces the gallery layout to a single column.
768px or less: Stacks most sections vertically, reduces padding, and adapts grid layouts for improved mobile viewing.
480px or less: Further reduces font sizes and padding for readability on very small devices.
